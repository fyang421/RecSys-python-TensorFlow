This project is to build a content based recommendation model that learns to rank. A random forest model was trained using scikit-learn and then a Wide&Deep model was trained using TensorFlow. Trained models predict the relevance socre of the candidate items. The predicted relevance scores can be used to rank the items and then serve to each user.
